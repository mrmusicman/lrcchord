# lrcchord


intended to play chords from a chord service in a command prompt.
file format in lrc format

## bugs

- need to add the/a downloader
- you have to scroll up in the command prompt for it to not flicker, and even then the cursor flickers
- please add a transpose mode

## lrc

```

Have one line for each beat, with the time being at the beginning of each beat. duplicates will be resolved in the chord diagrams on their own.
